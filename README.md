## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
 - **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
 - **DaisyUI** - Tailwind UI components plugin (used for card/button/badge styles)

## Content Preservation

All content has been preserved exactly as written in the original Quarto files, including:
- All text content and formatting
- All images and their captions
- All links and references
- YouTube embed for the "Better Steps" video
- Table structure for the SHAPE assessment
- All blockquotes and special formatting

The only changes made were:
- Converting from Quarto markdown to React JSX components
- Adding modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Implementing responsive navigation
- Removing extra sidebar items (keeping only Welcome and UTS 1-5 as requested)
